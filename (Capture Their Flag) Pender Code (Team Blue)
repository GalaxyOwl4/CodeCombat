# I got fifth with this code
# For this level you will have 3 main functions that you need to use.
# placeFlag - this should be called three times at the beginning of your code to hide your 3 flags
# findEnemyFlags - this should be called in order to locate enemy flags, it returns an array of any enemy flag within 5 units of you
# captureFlag - this is called on a flag you've found and captures it if you are within 3 units of the flag, then you can run the flag back to your side of the map
# you also have the ability to control your robot-walker, though he can only fire, not move
